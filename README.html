<h2>
Hosting the files
</h2>
<p>
To launch any of the samples, you will need to place the "DLR" and "Samples" folder on the root of a web server and load the html pages in your
favorite web browser.  You can place the DLR and Samples directory in different directories, but you may need to modify path information. 
When exposing the DLR folder through a local Apache or IIS instance. You may need to configure MIME-types for .slvx, .py, and .rb files.

<pre>
- For .slvx files set the MIME-type to: application/octet-stream
- For .rb and py files set the MIME-type to: text/plain
</pre>

</p>

<h2>
Downloading additional samples
</h2>
<p>
When you download individual samples and widgets from <a href="http://visitmix.com/labs/gestalt/samples/">the samples page</a>, just unzip them directly into the <a href="samples">samples folder</a>.  
so that each sample will be in a new subfolder beneath the samples folder.
